# Pizza Runner Challenge by Danny Ma <br />
link: [Danny Ma's SQL Challenges](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-1/) <br />
[SQL Code made with Postgresql](https://github.com/dcprecilla/Data-Analysis-Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/SQL%20Projects/Data%20with%20Danny%20Challenges/Danny's%20Diner/Danny_Diner.sql)
This is the first case study in Danny Ma's 8 weeks SQL challenge website. This project was launched in May 21, 2021 by Danny Ma. This case study is a practice study for me, as I have refreshed my skills with SQL. I did the challenge with PostgreSQL and pgAdmin4.

<b>Skills: Data Manipulation Language SQL, Aggregates in SQL, Customer Analysis, Window functions in SQL</b>

<i>Note: All of the queries of this github repo are my own, I do not have access to the official answers. The 8 weeks data challenge is open for everyone to try but the official solutions are paid content. I do believe that case studies regarding SQL sometimes have more than one solution and that is the beauty of this program. </i>
