# Exploratory Data Analysis of the California Inpatient Mortality Rates through the years 2016 to 2020 using Postgresql
## About the dataset: 
The title of the dataset is California Hospital Inpatient Mortality Rates and Quality Ratings
This dataset is from the official website: [data.gov ](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/california-hospital-inpatient-mortality-rates-and-quality-ratings-6815c).
I wanted to explore this dataset and derive answers to questions like:
- What is the leading cause of death for inpatient patients in California hospitals?
- How many inpatients deaths occur every year?
- Is there an increase or decrease with death count for the same ccondition year to year?
- Which hospital has the most death count? And which hospital has the least?
- How many survivors for these conditions?
- Which county has the highest death toll for inpatient patients?
