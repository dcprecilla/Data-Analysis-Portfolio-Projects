# Data wrangling and visualization with Data Professional Survery
## About the dataset
This dataset is from Alex the Analyst's github account. He launched a survey about data professionals ranging from Data Scientists, Analysts, Students and aspiring people who want to get into data. He used this dataset for his Power BI project and completely used Power BI even with the data wrangling. I thought of using this dataset to transform it through SQL, to showcase my skills in wrangling with SQL.
