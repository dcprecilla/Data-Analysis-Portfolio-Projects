# Darlene Precilla - Data Analysis Portfolio Projects

# About:
Hello! Thank you for landing on my portfolio page, I appreciate you exploring through my work. These projects are products hours of learning through platforms like DataCamp, YouTube, Coursera, Udemy,Medium, LinkedIn Learning (sponsored by our local library: Contra Costa County Library). I believe that in today's day and age that we all have access to quality tutorials and videos that can enhance our educational standing when it comes to gaining new skills. Some of these skills I've already learned back in my formal college years but brushing up is always important and updating current skills set is a must nowadays. <br /> I have broken down these projects into the following core technologies that I used:
## SQL [View Code Here](https://github.com/dcprecilla/Data-Analysis-Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/SQL%20Projects) 
## [MS Excel](https://github.com/dcprecilla/Data-Analysis-Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/Excel)
## [Power BI](https://github.com/dcprecilla/Data-Analysis-Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/Power_BI)

  - This is my very first coding competition to re-iterate what I have learned with their Python Fundamentals track, Data Manipulation with Pandas course and Joining data with pandas course. The project is with Datacamp's own workspace that is very much like jupyter notebooks.
