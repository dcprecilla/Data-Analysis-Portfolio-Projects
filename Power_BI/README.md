[PBIX File Here](https://github.com/dcprecilla/Data-Analysis-Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/Power_BI/Revenue%20Insights%20Hospitality%20Domain.pbix) <br />
About: <i>This dashboard is part of code basics portfolio projects challenge.</i><br />

We had to build a dashboard based on the Revenue Manager's requests:
- Create the metrics according to the metric list.
- Create a dashboard according to the mock-up provided by stakeholders.
- Create relevant insights that are not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard.

## Insights:
- First I had to put cards to indicate the KPIs: 
  - Revenue and the weekly change from previous week to current week
  - Occupany % 
  - Average Rating 
 - The data can be sliced/filtered by city, room type or week no. The week no is to compare the performance of the business on a weekly view. 
 - The table has a conditional formatting to compare the revenue at a glance per city, location and property.
 - Added the share of booking by plaform to see where bookings come from so the management can focus on where to get more bookings.
