Title: Revenue Insights Dashboard for a Hospitality Company based in India <br />
About: <i>This dashboard is part of code basics portfolio projects challenge.</i><br />

We had to build a dashboard based on the Revenue Manager's requests:
- Create the metrics according to the metric list.
- Create a dashboard according to the mock-up provided by stakeholders.
- Create relevant insights that are not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard.
